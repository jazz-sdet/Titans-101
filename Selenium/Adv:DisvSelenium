=========================
You need to follow following steps once you create new project for selenium 

1- Create one Java Project
2- Download Selenium jar files from selenium website
3- Download the chromedriver with latest version of chrome 
4- Add jar files to the Java project (File > Project Structure > Module > Dependencies > Plus Button)
5- Drag and drop the chrome driver into the project


DOM --> Document Object Model --> refers the HTML 

Locators --> We have 8 locators in Selenium to be able to identify the unique element on the page. 
1- id
2- name
3- class name 
4- link
5- partial links
6- tagname 
7- css selector
8- xpath

NOTE: Css is faster than xpath but xpath has more function to find the dynamic elements. 

Find Element Method 
This method returns the WebElement from the page. 

WebElement button=driver.findElement(Locators);
