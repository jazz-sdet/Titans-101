Differences between Ternary Operator and If Statement
1- Syntax is different between two implementations
2- We use Ternary Operator for short conditional statement but using if statement we can do more complicated implementation 


TERNARY OPERATOR
booleanCondition ? value1 : value2;

Value1 and value2 can be different data type. However if you are assigning the result of ternary operator to one data type, value1 and value2 should have same data type. 

sout( 5>3 ? "5 is bigger than 3" : 33 );


String result= 5>3 ? "5 is bigger than 3" : "33"; 


sout("33"+"33"); --> "3333"
sout(3+5+"7"); --> 87
sout(3+4+"4"+1+2); --> 7412

=========================================
Switch Statement

It is decision making structure where single matching case statement will be executed. If none of the case matching then default satement will be executed. 
Default is not required for switch statement. 

For Switch statement we can only use following data types: int, byte, short, char, String and ENUM. Those data types in case statement should be constant value for switch statement. Constant means not changable values. 

int studentNumber=124; 

switch(studentNumber){
	
	case 124:
		// body to execute the code
		sout("Muammer"); 
	break;
	case 123:
		sout("Tima"); 
	break;
	default: 
		sout("There is not student matching with given student number. ");

}

NOTE: In switch statement we can use default anywhere in implementation. If you use the default somewhere in the switch statement, we need to use the break for correct execution. 

1- We can not use more than one time same case value. 
2- 


int num=100; 

byte test=num; 

NESTED SWITCH STATEMENT
We can use switch statement inside another switch stement. 

TASK: 
Using scanner ask user to provide the state name Illinois or California

Once you find the matching case with given state name then ask user to provide city name 

then inside another case statement for cities print given state name and city name with following format

"The provided state name is STATENAME and city is CITYNAME "

ILLINOIS --> Chicago, Elgin, Rosement
California --> Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego

Difference between If Statement and Switch Statement 
1- Syntax is different 
2- In if statement we use boolean condition. However in switch statement we use certain data types like int, short, byte, String, char and ENUM values. 
3- In if statement we have else condition, for switch we have default statement. 
4- Instead switch we can use everytime if statement but we can not use switch everytime instead of if statement.

LOOPS 

In java we have 4 types of loops. 
While Loop, Do-While Loop, For Loop, ForEach loop 

NOTE: We use the loops when we try to execute the code multiple times with different value or same value. We can use while loop, do-while loop and for loop in our implementation. They will be working with same name only syntax is different.  


WHILE-LOOP 

while (booleanCondition){
	// body 
}
