Procedural Oriented Programming languages -> POP -> C language

OOP -> Object Oriented Programming language
Java, Python, JavaScript, C++...

public class Object {
	
}

Method Overridding:
-> We use @Override annotation in order to make sure we override the method
-> Method signature has to be same -> eat(String name){implementation} -> eat(String name){implementation}
-> Once we call the method it will execute the last overriden method



By default each class:
1. Extends Object class
2. Having no argument constructor
3. Constructor calling super class's no argument constructor with 'super()'


super(); -> will call super class's constructor
this();  -> will call same class's constructor

Constructor rules:
-> Sub class constructor will call no-argument constructor of super class by default -> 'super();'
-> But if it doesn't have no-argument constructor in super class, we will need explicitly call any argument constructor from super class
-> Once we use 'super()' it has to be first statement.


super    -> calls variables and methods of super class
super(); -> calls constructor of super class

this     -> calls variables and method of same class
this();  -> calls constructor of same class

-------------------------------

Abstraction
-------------

	Abstract Class -> Partially abstraction
	Interface -> Full abstraction

Abstract Class

	Where we have method names but not implementation of method.

	public void eat(){
	 	// implementation/body
	}


	public abstract void fly();


--------

Benefits of Inheritance:

1. It will make your code faster
2. Code is written once and you can use it all the time
3. Reduces software complexity
...


Method Overidding:
-> We use @Override annotation in order to make sure we override the method
-> Method signature has to be same -> eat(String name){implementation} -> eat(String name){implementation}
-> Once we call the method it will execute the last overriden method
-> Access modifier has to be same or more accessible
-> Return type has to be same or COVARIANT
-> Private or final methods can not be overriden


protected Object methodName(String name){
	// implementation
}

@Override
public String methodName(String name){
	// implementation
}



Can you override static method?
	* NO, static methods will not be overriden, but it will be hidden. (Static methods belongs to class)
	* Same for variables -> variables are not getting overriden but it is getting hidden.


Access Modifiers:
public    -> Can be accessed from everywhere
protected -> Can be accessed from same package, and from sub-class in different package.
default   -> Can be accessed from same package
private   -> Can be accessed within the same class


final keywords:
	final variable -> It has to be initialized and can not be changed. (CONSTANT variable). declared with upper case
	final method   -> can not be overriden
	final class    -> can not be inherited

Immutable -> String	is final class
			 Variables has to be declared as final (CONSTANT)
			 Setters method are not declared


------------------

INTERFACE:
----------

Full abstraction
Allows multiple inheritance

Bird -> Flyable, Noise -> Adjective

Bird IS An Animal

Flyable IS An Object

Abstract Class vs Interface:
-----------------------------
1. Only one abstract class can be inherited while multiple interfaces (Abstract Data Type) can be inherited
2. Abstract class is partially abstraction, interface is full abstraction
3. Both of them may not be marked 'final'
4. Both can not be instantiated(create an Object)
5. All interface variables are constant (public static final), while in abstract class we can have regular variables
6. While interface is inherited by a class we use 'implements' while in for abstract class we use 'extends'. And if 	one interface inherits another interface we use keyword 'extends'.
7. In interface methods are 'public abstract' by default, while in abstract class we need to declare abstract methods with 'abstract' keyword.

Interface Methods:
------------------
1. Non-default method -> which 'public abstract' by default.
2. Default method     -> we use 'default' keywod for the method and it will be regular public method.
3. Static method      -> we use 'static' keyword and it will be regular static method


** Concrete class -> first regular class that inherits Abstract class or Interface

A bigram is any two adjacent words in the text disregarding case and punctuation. A histogram is the count of how many times that particular bigram occurred in the text. Write the method will take String and it will return the map with count of particular bigram occurred in the text.
Example:
 Given the text:
 “The quick brown fox and the quick blue hare.” The bigrams with their counts would be. Output:
 “the quick” 2
 “quick brown” 1
 “brown fox” 1
 “fox and” 1
 “and the” 1
 “quick blue” 1
 “blue hare” 1


1. String sentence = “The quick brown fox and the quick blue hare.”;
  Remove all punctuation
2. Make it lower case

3. “the quick brown fox and the quick blue hare”

4. Store all bigrams into the list ("the quick", "quick brown", "brown fox"...)

5. Create a map where you will be storing bigram as key and value as count

6. Using nested for loop count each value from this list and store it to map.

7. return the map

-----------------

POLYMORPHISM:
--------------

1. Code reusability
2. Code readable
3. Performance

Polymorphism -> Many forms
	Poly   -> Many
	Morphs -> forms

Forms (References)    |    Objects

Object p              =    new Iphone();


Object
Animal
	DomesticAnimal
		Cat
	WildAnimal
		Tiger



Animal cat = new DomesticAnimal();



Animal dog = new Dog();

Polymorphism -> is an ability of an object to take many references (forms).

And reference type will decide which methods and variables to call

Down Casting -> If you want to get variable or method from Object side class 
	((Dog)dog).sleep();

Up Casting   -> is redundant (not needed), because it is done implicitely (automatically).

Casting to unrelated types -> It will compile but It will throw classCastException.


Two types of Polymorphism:
	Dynamic Polymorphism -> It will be decided which method to execute at runtime
	Static Polymorphism  -> It will be decided which method to execute at compile time

	2. Make it readable
	3. Reduce software complexity

-> Inheritance

	Static Polymorphism  -> Method Overloading -> method will be decided at compile time
	Down Casting

	ClassCastException
-> Encapsulation -> having private variables and giving them an access through getters and setters
	Let the code not easily being changed or understand which varible is being

	Dog dog = new Dog();
	dog.name="Dog";
	dog.setName("Dog");



Exceptions
-----------

OCA -> Oracle Certified Associate
OCP -> Oracle Certified Programmer
OCM -> Oracle Certified Master


Exceptions
	Checked Exceptions   -> Compile time exception, we have to handle these exceptions
	Unchecked Exceptions -> Runtime exception, we can handle these exceptions
Error -> Something horribly wrong happened that we shouldn't be recovering from


Try catch block    -> Will handle the exception and will continue for code execution.
Method declaration -> will handle the exception and if exception is occured then it will throw that exception.


throw  -> when we explicitely throw an exception
throws -> when we delcare that method mkight throw an exception in method signature

finally block -> will be excecuted in any case if there will exception or no exception. But we can skip finally with
System.exit(0);

System.gc(); -> will clean heap memery with unused objects.


Creating your own Exception!

throwing NazgulException

/ by 0
null
no such directory of file



Bank App
---------

InsufficientFundsException -> In order to create your own exception you need to inherit Throwable type of class.


public void printName(Function name){
	
}

String name = "John";

Function function = public void printCondition(){
						sout("Name");
					}

object.printName(function);
