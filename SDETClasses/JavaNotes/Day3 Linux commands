JDK needed to write and run java code
JDK has JRE insdie and dev tools (java, javac, jar, javadoc etc)

JRE to be able to run java code we need jre.
Inside JRE is JVM and liblraries to run java code

JVM converts code line by line for comp. According to conversin java executes the command which is coming from java

Why did we choose Java


Features of Java Programming Language?
Java is Object Oriented Programming language. It is close the 100% of OOP.
Great collection open source tools such as (Selenium WebDriver, Rest-Assured Library, TestNG, JUNIT). Open source tool means free java libraries that you use with Java prog language.
Community support -- helps to find solution within java community over internet.
Documentation support has great doc suport provided by oracle.
Platform independed, java can be written on any platform such as windows and be run on linux
Java is the language that you can write once and run everywhere(WORA)

f.ex: .xls, .xlsx excel file ext
.doc, .docx for word doc
.txt for NOTES file ext
.png, .jpg picture fileext
.java java file ext

JDK(Java Development Kit)
TO be able to write and run the java code we need JDK. 
Inside JDK we have JRE and development tools(java, javac, jar, javadoc etc). 
JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
To be able to run the java code we need JRE. 
Inside JRE we have JVM and other libraries to run the java code
JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
It will convert your code line by line for computer. According to that the computer will execute the command which is coming from java code. 
=====================================
Why did you choose the Java as Programming Language? 
- I know a lot of companies implementing the automation framework using java programming language. That's why I choose java. I think that it will be easy for me once I start working in the company. 
Features of Java Programming Language
1- Java is Object Oriented Programming Language. It is close the %100 of OOP. 
2- Java has great collection of open source tools like (Selenium WebDriver, Rest-Assured Library, TestNG, JUNIT). Open source tool means free java libraries that you can use with Java Programming Language. 
3- Community support --> you can find the solution for your java problems easily in the internet. 
4- Documentation support --> Java has great documentation which is provided by oracle company. 
5- Java is platform independent. So you can write the code in Windows platform and run in Linux. 
6- Java is the language that you can Write Once Run Everywhere (WORA)
TASK: with cat go to the top of your y coordinate then draw the triangle as a roof of your house using red pen color. 
ScreenShot for Mac --> command+shift+4
Windows Users
Windows user go left down of the computer screen there should one search box. Powershell
Windows Powershell X86
Mac Users
Go to the right top side of your screen and there is one search button. Search "Terminal" and open the terminal application
