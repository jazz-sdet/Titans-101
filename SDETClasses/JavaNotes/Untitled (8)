Procedural Oriented Programming languages -> POP -> C language

OOP -> Object Oriented Programming language
Java, Python, JavaScript, C++...

public class Object {
	
}

Method Overridding:
-> We use Override annotation in order to make sure we override the method
-> Method signature has to be same
-> Once we call the method it will execute the last overriden method



By default each class:
1. Extends Object class
2. Having no argument constructor
3. Constructor calling super class's no argument constructor with 'super()'


super(); -> will call super class's constructor

Constructor rules:
-> Sub class constructor will call no-argument constructor of super class by default
-> But if it doesn't have no-argument constructor in super class, we will need explicitly call any argument constructor from super class
-> Once we use 'super()' it has to be first statement.
